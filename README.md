Feedback
========

This is github feedback project inspired by many others.

The principles are simple, if you have any question, comment or anything you want to discuss publically with me, just open an issue on the issue tracker with all the information needed, tag it and that's all!. 

Feel free to use it as you want, I'll try to answer as possible!

Cheers!

Rui
